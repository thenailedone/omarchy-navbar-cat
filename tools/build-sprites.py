"""Turn oneko's XBM bitmap/mask pairs into the spritesheets the plugin ships.

oneko encodes each frame as two 32x32 bitmaps: an image and a mask. Inside the
mask, a set image bit is ink (the outline and facial detail, drawn black in the
original) and a clear bit is fill (the cat's body, drawn white). We keep that
two-tone structure so the cat can be themed at runtime rather than baked to
fixed colours.

Output is two alpha-only sheets per size:

  *-fill.png   alpha = the whole silhouette (mask)
  *-ink.png    alpha = the detail only (image AND mask)

The fill sheet carries the *entire* silhouette rather than just the non-ink
pixels, and the ink sheet is painted over it. Splitting them into disjoint
regions instead would leave hairline seams between the two layers wherever the
compositor scales the sprite by a non-integer factor.

Sheets are emitted at 32px (native) and 16px (reduced). The 16px reduction maps
each 2x2 block with an "ink if any, mask if any" rule. A majority rule was
tried first and rejected: oneko's outlines are 1px, so majority voting breaks
them into dashes and the cat stops reading as a cat at a glance.
